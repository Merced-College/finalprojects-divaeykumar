# Smart Task Manager

Overview:
The Smart Task Manager is a java console-based application designed to help users create, view, and manage their tasks for their day-to-day lives. This application uses classes, object-oriented programming, object-oriented design, and standard data structures such as vectors to provide a basic but functional productivity system. I plan to try and implement this in the computer science club or a canvas or calendar page.

This project was built as part of a final Computer Science assignment and presented at a science fair. I plan on expanding this by implementing a 3 star system for completing tasks
